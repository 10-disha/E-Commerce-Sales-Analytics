# E-Commerce-Sales-Analytics

## Project Overview
E-commerce is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet. The COVID-19 global e-commerce surge was initially born out of necessity. Online shopping provided a practical alternative as retail locations closed and people stayed in to avoid the virus. Hence, in this project we tried to show the trend in E-Commerce in terms of sales, profit and predict the growth of the companies over the years.
